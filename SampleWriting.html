            <p class="mbr-text align-left pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5"><strong>The four corners area comprised of Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico in the Southwest of the United States is a culturally rich and diverse region that provides many historical treasures that are preserved in its many pueblos. <br><br>This region has been a hub to a diverse variety of languages and peoples, ranging from dialects of Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, Zuni and Keres, and the peoples of early Basketmakers and Puebloans to the more modern peoples of Navajo, Hopi, and Utes (Dutton 1976). The harsh desert environment and trauma from warfare had strong influence on the development of these peoples’ social complexity. The phenomena of human existence in this region created ritual behaviors which influenced the way the landscape was used through architecture. These inhabitants left permanent marks on the landscape and even earned their name as the ancestral Puebloan society from the adobe structures they created. <br><br>The shift of Paleoindian and Archaic peoples subsistence from plant wild foods with focus on wild game to the Basketmakers adopting cultivation of corn and squash with use of storage and pottery. This shift is of huge importance because this region has a desert climate which does not provide much plant productivity. Integrating maize production gave the people a starch food or cereal they were able to manage in a local area and maintain in food stores. There is evidence of ditch systems but without a consistent water table or wet period it is difficult to see horticulture as reliable in this region. (Lekson 2007) Hunting continued to be the highest return rate for caloric gain by eating the meat in relation to the expense or cost of time and energy of hunting (Kohler 2012). But with this integration of a new and storable food source, like maize, ancestral people were able to transition from a nomadic style of hunting-gathering to a more sedentary form of life, creating pueblos with road systems. 
<br> Plazas and courts were created as a central community center for these societies with farmsteads loosely clustered around them. “Pit-houses” or subterranean dwellings are regarded as the oldest form of buildings in these pueblos and are called kivas. (Fewkes 1999) These kivas are circular and lie in the middle of several square rooms, indicating that the rooms were added later. Circular kivas are characteristic to the classification of pueblo culture and have different morphology, geography, and genetic remains than rectangle kivas from more southern and western pueblo areas. Great kivas first appeared during the time of the Basketmaker III phase around 500 AD and were continued to be built until around the time Mesa Verde was abandoned in 1300 AD (Ferguson 1996).
<br>The kivas found in the Mesa Verde Region and Chaco Canyon are semi-subterranean, circular or oval, with their roofs being level with the floor of the surrounding plaza. The roof is the main entrance for kivas but some also contain private passageways with openings existing in the walls. Kivas are constructed by two walls, the inner/lower wall enclose the room and support six pedestals which hold beams that are supported by the outer wall. The lower wall also contains several small cubby-holes as receptacles for small ceremonial objects and paint. Every kiva has a deflector which functions as an air distributor, a single fire-place, and a sipapu which is a small hole or indentation in the floor to symbolize the portal through which their ancient ancestors first emerged to enter the present world. The main weight of the roof is supported by two large parallel diametric logs with the space between them determining the size of the doorway. Two more beams are placed across these logs and the roof filled in with other logs, sticks, and twigs. (Fewkes 1999)
<br>Looking in the Mesa Verde Region lies the poorly named Spruce-tree House (the surrounding trees being instead piñons, pines, and cedars) and just south, Cliff Palace. Spruce Tree House contains 114 rooms and 8 kivas, allowing probably 100 residents.  Its kivas have been labeled A-H, from north to south following the canyon. Cliff Palace has 22 kivas labeled A-V starting south and curving west as the kivas go north. M is a subtype of kiva and O, R, and V are a second type, showing variability and complexity in architecture. The sipapu of kiva D contained a small deerskin bag tied with yucca fibers filled with iron pyrites. This site may have housed 350 people. Both sites have remains of lots of fabrics, woven basketry, planting stick, bone implements, sandals, seeds: corn, squash, pumpkin, beans, and gourd pieces, as well as an abundance of corn leaves, stalks, and tassels in the refuse. Spruce Tree had a stone axe with handle and Cliff Palace had turquoise ear pendants as well as large scrapers. Along with the large scrapers were traces of antelope, bear, small mammals, and birds. (Fewkes 1999)
<br>These kivas were not only constructed first but also most likely supported a senior lineage. Oversized pit structures were homes to the successful lineage heads who were the hunt leaders. Kivas provided ceremonial rooms for males to perform exclusive religious rituals as well as have political meeting places. Rituals are also performed in plazas where ritual intensification can be seen. The hierarchies in this area are heavily debated as some scholars believe that Chaco was ruled by kings and queens, some reject the possibility of rule by members of ritual hierarchies, and some view the Pueblo as the “world’s few garden-variety chiefdoms or petty kingdoms or cacicazgos” (Pauketat 2012 pg. 554) Cacicazgo is the term of a Spanish transliteration of the Taíno word for the lands ruled by a cacique or chief/leader. Regardless of who ruled the focus of culture was on the ethereal and cosmos. The plaza, or empty space, of the Pueblo form contains the middle or center of the cosmos as the kiva also contains the center. Pueblos are thought to be a reflect and microcosm of the larger creation. Non-substantial elements are given importance in town form. There is a center-finding process or determination of the void connecting this world with the underworlds, by Water-Spider(bug) and/or Rainbow, and the void of the Pueblo form or the plaza is created. (VanPool 2006) These behaviors developed as an effect of the social complexity provided from the community structures. As people congregated they formed common beliefs. The environment also provided a very clear view of the night sky and stars leading to great knowledge and intimacy with the constellations.
<br>Great House communities with Great Kivas and imported lithic material can be seen starting 775-850 outside of and around Chaco Canyon. These imported materials support trade networks. The communities dispersed across the landscape shifted their social landscape from Great Houses to reformatted Great Kivas, giving rise to the habitation of Chaco Canyon in 860. Formal great kiva construction did not take place in Chaco Canyon until the Classic Bonito phase from 1040-1100. Great Houses with great kivas associated in Chaco Canyon are found in Pueblo Bonito, Chetro Ketl, Kin Nahasbas, Una Vida, Hungo Pavi, and Peñasco Blanco as well as four isolated great kivas on the south side. (Lekson 1987)
<br>There was much exchange between the southern people of Chaco Canyon with their northern neighbors of the Mesa Verde Region. Following the shift towards Great Kivas and Pueblos in Chaco Canyon, the peoples who had inhabited the mesas of the Mesa Verde Region for 600 years now moved to the cliff sides below them creating Yellow Jacket in 1050, Cliff Palace around 1190, and Spruce Tree in 1211. Tree rings show a severe drought from 1130-1180. This lack of water created lack of vegetation, timber, and game. The ancestral Pueblo people lined the cliff sides of canyons along areas with permanent water sources. A move to a secure permanent water sources in times of drought is logical. (Whiteford 1988) Looking at how the environment affected ancestrals people’s ability to maintain sustenance we can see the effect this had on their architecture. So then how did the building of kivas in turn affect their culture and maize based religion?
<br>First, let’s look into detail at the environment.  Looking at ET/CRR we can see that estimated temperature is similar for Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde, both around 13 but Mesa Verde has twice the amount of rainfall than Chaco Canyon.   
<br><br>Looking at EXAREA1/WDEN1 (Figure 2) we see that Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde are similar again, both around 750 for projected total area, scaled for subsistence type, for groups with year-round camp to camp mobility patterns with Mesa Verde having 1.5 larger a projected density. Perhaps having twice as much rainfall allows for the sustaining of twice as many people. These projections are not for Ancestral Puebloan peoples but for their hunting and gathering ancestors. High population density per foraging area could set up foragers for food stress, creating a receptiveness to introduced maize. The desert provides low vegetation making intensification optimal.
<br>Maize was introduced into the Colorado Plateau around 2000BC but invested in lightly for 1000 years. Leading up to this period of Pueblo people from 7000-1BC people developed from nomadic hunter/gatherers into sedentary villagers who raised corn and beans. Referring to Michael Shaver’s presentation of the Horti people near the North Great Lakes we see maize introduced into the area 500-600 AD but not become significant until around 1000AD. Maize was introduced into the Colorado Plateau around 2000BC but also invested in lightly for 1000 years. (Toll 1995) Classifications of Chacoan culture by different archaeologists are ranging from -100 to 1300AD.  Although hunting remained the primary source of sustenance, maize now provided a food source that was storable. The density of population could be a response to climatic factors and resource stress shifting towards maize production. The adoption of and investment in maize opened an avenue of a storable resource. Maize was used heavily in rituals and has a prominence in spiritual life. This influenced site size, location, and structure as well as permanence. Architecture was planned around solar and lunar events, as well dependence on sun and rain for the growing season. (Lekson 2007) Alignment and precision are exact. Architecture reflects large spiritual influence and the value of maize in their culture.
<br><br>Although corn was integrated into sustenance the main food was still obtained through hunting. NAGP/EXPREY or net above-ground productivity, which measures new cell life added to a habitat because of photosynthesis and growth aka plant production, compared with the expected moderate body-size ungulate biomass (kg/km2) shows a very slight positive relationship indicating that where there is more plant life there are more ungulates.  The results of comparing these two are very scattered with a stronger relationship in Colorado and the weakest relationship in New Mexico. Mesa Verde Region shows more life in both primary and secondary resources than Chaco Canyon. <br> 
<br>Food species tended to be small, dispersed packages like jackrabbits, low flying birds, and deer. This reflects the dry desert terrain favoring smaller animals who need less to survive. Chaco Canyon also shows a rise in large animal hunting and a decrease in small mammal hunting around 750AD, the same time as the shift towards inhabiting the canyon cliffsides. This could be from larger animals like deer consistently coming to the water sources, which is now where people are gathered instead of being spread out across the land where they would randomly come into contact with smaller prey like rabbits. SUBSPE or main source of sustenance was a 1 for the entire area. This supports hunting as priority over maize production/consumption.  Research shows that only about 25% of diet is from stored corn. <br>
<br>There was also much exchange, mainly raids, between Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde Region with Apaches, Comanches, and Navajos. Pueblos are built like fortresses in this harsh environment.  The Sacred Ridge Site on Pueblo I shows evidence of perimortem trauma, foot and ankle bone damage as evidence of beating or blows to the body caused by humans. This site could suggest Comanche kidnapping with the wounds to prevent escape. This is supported by pots also found here that came from Texas in 700-900AD. Cowboy Wash Site dates back to 1150s AD where a small pit house settlement was destroyed with some of its inhabitants killed and eaten. The Mancos site in the eastern region of Mesa Verde from approximately 1100AD has human bodies with extreme modification suggesting Hopi and Navajo witchcraft. This also coincides with the move from mesa tops to cliffsides suggesting maybe not only warfare but religious violence or cannibalism. Castle Rock Pueblo built mid-AD 1200s shows evidence of systematic attacks and brutalized casualties among its inhabitants. Many pueblos and arroyos were burned and contained destructed domestic assemblages attributed to warfare in the 1200-1350 AD. Chaco Canyon as well as other pueblos show planned processes of abandonment. This area is in open, bare landscapes with a hostile energy to it. Pueblos are designed in defense of communities. This structure influences architecture and religious features. 
<br>Environmental influences such as the low vegetation of the desert created a situation where intensification was optimal. The introduction of maize created a storable resource which influenced the development of community structures to contain it in. Other influences like warfare led to the development of social complexity created with in the community structures of the fortresses of pueblos. These pueblos originated around great kivas which influenced ritual behavior and the traditions of the pueblo people who evolved from hunting and gathering ancestors.
<br>Another interesting factor to consider is how much people congregated. By looking at EXGRP3 or the projected mean size of periodic regional camps, segmented by group pattern and subsistence specialization bias and comparing that with WDEN which is the projected hunter-gatherer density created by taking the mean of WDEN1(Projected HG Density1: calculated from equation run on proportional subset of HG cases.) and WDEN2(Projected HG Density2: calculated from equation run on total HG file.) we can see how much people aggregated. The first chart is divided by states. Utah has the highest EXGRP3 with a relatively low population showing many sites were used for trade and exchange but not widely lived in. New Mexico has the highest population densities with very low aggregations which suggests that these populations were large and stationary creating consistent homes. This can be seen in New Mexico’s large architecture like Chaco Canyon. Colorado has a negative relationship where the smaller populations meet more often to trade and larger populations like Mesa Verde meet less. 
<br>
<br>Taking these same variables, we can compare packed gathering or the percentage of dependence on the gathering of food. This was chart was made by creating a GATHORD or ordinal based on gathering amounts. In this chart 1 is the lowest gathering, 2 is a medium amount, and 3 is the most of gathering. In the second chart, Mesa Verde shows not much gathering at a 1, while Chaco Canyon has lots of gathering at a 3. The interesting thing is that these two regions aggregate fairly similar amounts, yet the population of Mesa Verde is almost double that of Chaco Canyon. This means that more people in Mesa Verde are gathering less food yet meeting just as much to sustain themselves. Even more interesting is the relationship of the ordinal numbers themselves. 1 has a positive relationship, where there is more density there is more aggregation. 2 is slightly negative, the opposite of 1, which indicates that there is a maximum or peak at which there are enough people to trade with within a larger population that people do not need to meet outside of that group to sustain themselves. 3 is scattered all over the place but does not exceed the population density of 4.00. There seems to be a limit on gathering for the higher population density. This also reflects the importance of permanent structures or sedentary lifestyle, where creating a consistent home base for people to trade eliminates the need to aggregate in other spaces.
<br>     
<br>Rico is included in the chart because it was consistently a huge outlier in every other chart yet in this one it is very central. From this arises the question whether society arose from exclusion or inclusion. At a 1 Rico has low gathering with a smaller/medium population and less/medium aggregations for trade. Rico has the highest rainfall, elevation, EXPREY, and almost highest NAGP yet these people are not as successful in a societal system as Chaco Canyon or Mesa Verde. These variables are the most telling because it helps show the chain links between population and aggregations. Environment affects sustenance in obvious ways of growth abilities. Rico has the most plant sustenance, which affects population density by providing nutrition and energy. A storable sustenance affects movement, aggregations, and sedentary architecture. The chart does show a lack of correlation between population, sustenance gathering, and aggregation, but we can see that the populations who gather more didn’t have to meet as often for trade. These people already had enough. Artifacts also show a strong trade network. Lithic artifacts from foreign places are found within puebloes which supports a large trade network. Kohler looks into the variation of raw materials and calculates the cost distance and social accessibility throughout time and how this affects stone tool procurement. The trajectories of lithic material distributions through out time also supports the influence of factors like environment, demography, and the sociopolitical climate.
<br> The more permanent settlements developed culture and this culture put importance on its ability to stay stationary which was provided by the storage of maize. These first permanent structures were kivas and the pueblos were built around them. The link between these permanent settlement is the value in creating safe havens against raids as well as a network system supported by rituals carried out in the safe spaces that plazas provide. Kivas and maize production developed hand in hand and strongly influenced these ancestral people's way of life.
